<h1>Some previous projects</h1>
<p>To show the directions in which Visio's user extensions can develop,
I will give a few examples from my experience.</p>
<p>These things were done at different times, something for themselves,
something to order. Most often they specialize and can not be reapplied without changes.
That is, the list should be seen as an example of "what others have done" and "what can be done".</p>
