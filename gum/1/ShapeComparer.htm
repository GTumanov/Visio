<p><b>ShapeComparer</b> - is a utility for shape developers. The utility performs
operations such as: comparison of shapes, copying shape-sheet
formulas, copying shape-sheet sections.</p>
<p>The utility is designed as a Visio stencil, containing macros.</p>

<p>ShapeComparer features:</p>
<ul>
<li>comparison of the two shapes with the recording of the results in the log;
<li>copying formulas from one shapes to a other;
<li>copying sections from one shape to a other;
<li>duplication pages.
</ul>
<p>The utility is framed as a stencil containing the master shapes and macros.
For applying the utilitiy you need to open a stencil and use
the context menu of master shapes.</p>
<h3>Shapes comparison</h3>
<p>To compare two shapes you need to connect them with the CompShape connector
and use <b>Compare</b> menu. The comparison protocol will saved in a text file "log.log".</p>
<p>The connector contains two fields that control the format of the protocol.</p>
<p>If the <b>Print cell names</b> Field is set to "True", the list of cell names
is added to the protocol. If that field is set to "False", only differences is written.</p>
<p>Field <b>Print both formulas</b> affects the output format of the result.
If the field is set to "True", the compared cell appears beside (in two columns).
If the field is set to "False", first all cells of one shape are displayed, then of another..</p>
<p>Sample of output format with <b>Print both formulas = True</b>:</p>
<table width=50%>
<tr><td>Sheet.2!PinX = 41 mm</td><td>Sheet.3!PinX = 152 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheet.2!PinY = 226 mm</td><td>Sheet.3!PinY = 244 mm</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Sample of output format with <b>Print both formulas = False</b>:</p>
<table width=50%>
<tr><td>------------------------------------</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheet.2!PinX = 41 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheet.2!PinY = 226 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>------------------------------------</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheet.3!PinX = 152 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheet.3!PinY = 244 mm</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The second option gives the compact notation that can be used successfully
to document the development of shapes.</p>

<h3>Copying formulas</h3>
<p>During the comparison of shapes together with the writting
of the results in the log the names list of different cells is formed
and recorded in the connector shape. It is stored in a drop-down
list in the Differences field.</p>
<p>If you select one position in this list and perform the
<b>Copy formula</b> function, the formula will be copied from the
original shapes to the destination.</p>
<p>Thus, you can quickly copy multiple cells.</p>

<h3>Copying section</h3>
<p>During the comparison of shapes also the names list of
different sections is formed and recorded in the connector shape.
It is stored in a drop-down list in the Sections field.</p>
<p>If you select one position in this list and perform the
<b>Copy section</b> function, all cells of this section will be copied from the
original shapes to the destination.</p>
<IMG SRC="image006.jpg" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="208" BORDER="0" ALT="">
<p><b>Copy sections</b> function preliminary removes a similar section in the target shapes.
There is <b>Add to section</b> function. This function is usefull for section with named rows.
When it is executed the existing rows are not removed.</p>
<p>Restriction: Geometry section and Text Fields section will not be copied</p>
<h3>Duplication pages</h3>
<p>To duplicate pages, you may use the CopyPage master shape. Drag it to the desired
Visio page and execute the menu command <b>Copy page</b>. A copy of the active page
will be added to the end of the document.</p>
<p>Master shape has the <b>Destination page</b> field. Enter in this field a name
of the page to compare, and use <b>Compare</b> menu. The comparison protocol will
saved in a text file log.log.</p>
<p>Duplicate function is not used in Visio 2013. Visio 2013 performs this
operation by regular means. But in earlier versions of Visio it can be useful.</p>
<p>The function has a restriction - it does not work in the presence of groups.</p>
